    "#  1.Primary Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "# A Primary Key is a column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each record (row) in a table.\n",
    "# It must contain unique values for each row and cannot contain NULL values.\n",
    "# Every table in a relational database should have a Primary Key, as it serves as a unique identifier for the records.\n",
    "# Typically, Primary Keys are implemented using unique indexes.\n",
    "# Examples of Primary Key columns include employee ID, student ID, order ID, etc.\n",
    "# 2. Foreign Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "# A Foreign Key is a column or set of columns in a table that refers to the Primary Key of another table.\n",
    "# It establishes a relationship between two tables by referencing the Primary Key column(s) of one table in another table.\n",
    "# Foreign Keys help enforce referential integrity, ensuring that data in related tables remain consistent.\n",
    "# When a Foreign Key is defined in a table, the values in that column must match the values of the Primary Key column(s) in the referenced table, or be NULL (if the Foreign Key column allows NULL values).\n",
    "# Foreign Keys can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationships between tables.\n",
    "# Examples of Foreign Key columns include employee ID referencing a department table, customer ID referencing an order table, etc.\n",
