    "# # Q1. What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?\n",
    "# Ans:-Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It's lightweight and designed to be simple and easy to use, making it a popular choice for building web applications and APIs.\n",
    "# Here are some advantages of Flask:\n",
    "# 1.Lightweight: Flask is minimalist by design, providing just the essentials for web development. This simplicity makes it easy to learn and use.\n",
    "# 2.Flexibility: Flask allows developers to choose the components they need, such as templating engines, databases, and authentication methods, rather than imposing specific choices. This flexibility makes it suitable for a wide range of use cases.\n",
    "# 3.Extensibility: Flask is highly extensible, with a rich ecosystem of extensions available to add additional functionality as needed. These extensions cover areas such as authentication, database integration, and testing.\n",
    "# 4.Easy to Get Started: Flask has a simple and intuitive API, making it easy for developers to get started building web applications quickly.\n",
    "# 5.Integrated Development Server: Flask comes with a built-in development server, so you can start developing your application right away without needing to set up a separate server environment.\n",
    "# 6.Pythonic: Flask follows the principles of Python, making it familiar to Python developers and integrating seamlessly with other Python libraries and frameworks.\n",
    "# Overall, Flask's simplicity, flexibility, and extensibility make it a popular choice for building web applications and APIs in Python."
