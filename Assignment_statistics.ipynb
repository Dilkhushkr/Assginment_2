    "# 1.Covariance:- and correlation are both measures used in statistics to describe the relationship between two variables, but they serve slightly different purposes and have distinct characteristics.\n",

    "# Covariance can be positive, negative, or zero:\n",

    "# Negative covariance (Cov(X, Y) < 0) indicates that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.\n",
    "# Zero covariance (Cov(X, Y) ≈ 0) suggests no linear relationship between the variables.\n",
    "# The problem with covariance is that its magnitude depends on the units of the variables, making it difficult to compare across different datasets.\n",
    "# 2.Correlation:\n",
    "# Correlation is a standardized measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It provides a value between -1 and 1, where -1 represents a perfect negative linear relationship, 1 represents a perfect positive linear relationship, and 0 represents no linear relationship.\n",
    "# The most common measure of correlation is the Pearson correlation coefficient (r), which is calculated as:\n",
    "# r = (Σ [(Xᵢ - X̄) * (Yᵢ - Ȳ)]) / [√Σ(Xᵢ - X̄)² * Σ(Yᵢ - Ȳ)²]\n",
    "# Unlike covariance, correlation is unitless and standardized, making it easier to compare across datasets.\n",
    "# Correlation quantifies the degree to which two variables move together and the strength of the linear association between them.\n",
